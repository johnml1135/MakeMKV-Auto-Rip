# ddrescue-recover.sh
#
# Image a (possibly damaged) optical disc with GNU ddrescue, skipping unreadable
# areas so a usable copy can still be produced even when individual sectors are
# physically unreadable. Intended to be invoked from the MakeMKV Auto Rip
# read-error recovery service through the MSYS2 bash shell on Windows.
#
# Usage:
#   ddrescue-recover.sh <device> <output-image-path>
#
#   <device>             Optical device node inside MSYS2, e.g. /dev/sr0
#   <output-image-path>  Destination image path (Windows "C:\..." or MSYS path)
#
# Behaviour is tuned through environment variables (all optional):
#   DDR_RETRIES       Retry count for the scraping passes          (default: 3)
#   DDR_TIMEOUT       ddrescue --timeout value, e.g. "30m". Aborts a pass when
#                     no data is read for this long. Empty disables.  (default: "")
#   DDR_MAX_RUNTIME   Hard wall-clock ceiling in SECONDS for the whole run; a
#                     watchdog stops every pass once it elapses.  (default: 0 = off)
#   DDR_REVERSE       "1" to add a reverse-direction scraping pass    (default: 1)
#   DDR_DIRECT        "1" to use direct disc access (-d / O_DIRECT)   (default: 0)
#   DDR_RESUME        "1" to resume from an existing image+mapfile    (default: 1)
#
# Produces <image> plus <image>.map (ddrescue mapfile) and <image>.size (the
# device size, used to detect a different disc on resume). The mapfile lets a
# later run resume only the still-unreadable areas, e.g. after cleaning the disc.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0    success (some data recovered)
#   2    bad arguments
#   3    ddrescue not found on PATH
#   4    device not readable (no Administrator rights, no media, or dead disc)
#   5    no data recovered
#   143  stopped by signal or by the max-runtime watchdog (partial image kept)
